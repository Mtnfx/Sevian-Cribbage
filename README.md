# Sevian Cribbage Engine
A modular Python engine, designed mainly for Sevian Cribbage; a custom version of cribbage with five suits.

## Features

### Current
 - Four primary data structures (Card, Deck, Hand, Stack)
 - 17 of 65 total playing card sprites

### Planned
- Player class for modular handling of player interactions
- Arcade based UI for interactive play
- Multiple computer opponents with distinct behaviour

## Structure
- `assets/` - sprites and other visual/audio assets
- `core/` - foundational data structures and helper functions for engine
- `tests/` - testing functions for key functionalities

## How to Run
This project currently does not produce any runtime output. Interactive components and a clean entry point will be added once the main features of the engine are implemented.

## Roadmap
- Add testing for implemented class methods
- Implement game sequencing logic
- Add computer opponents
- Produce Arcade based UI
